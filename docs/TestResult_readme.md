# TestResult
TestResult is a class with companion script to import test results and calculate statistics.  The input is a log file from the battery charger.  The output is a csv of formatted status lines and min, max, and average values for voltage and current over each phase of the test.  Duration for each phase and charge and discharge cycle are also calculated.  Results will have to be manually comparted with expected test limits.

## Installation 
1. Install Python 3 if not installed on pc
2. Unzip TestResult.zip

## Usage
1. Place log file to be processed in TestResult directory
2. Open command prompt in TestResult directory
3. Run `TestResult.py [filename].txt`
